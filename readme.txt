This project has come to existence only because of SAI.

INTRODUCTION:-
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This project is an implementation of mini computer server systems in an hospital that is used as the 
data base for the administration as well as used by patients to review their data given by the doctor.
This executable file has four types of users.....

They are....
1.Administration
2.Employees of the hospital
3.Doctors in the hospital
4.Patients visiting the hospital.

Administration:-
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For any admin user to enter into their account they have to provide a password...which wont be shown 
on the screen.A character '*' is displayed as and when any character is pressed...
Once a correct password("sreeabhi") is provided the admin has the following things he can do...
1.Take the info of new employee who joins into the hospital and give them an unique ID.
2.Take any new doctor who joins into the hospital and give them an unique ID.
3.Look at all the details of the staff who are there in the hospital.
4.Look at all the infrastructure and add any new department into the hospital.
5.Log out of his account.
In most of the circumstances the admin will have the maximum power to alter any part of the information

Employees:-
~~~~~~~~~~
For any employees in the hospital to enter into their account they just have to enter their Unique ID
provided by the Admin at the time of their join into the hospital.
They can do the following things once they log into their accounts:-
1.View their profile.
2.Change their data(but only few things like their address,email& phone number)
3.Look at the infrastructure they have in their department.
4.Log out.
There are few employees who can do other things than this...
for eg.
1.If the employee works in the reception(UID is 173001) she can enter the details of any new patient 
who comes to the hospital...
2.If the employee works in the medical store(UID is 173002) of the hospital he can add any medicine
to the existing medicines and increase their quantity in the stores or add any new medicines into the
stores...
(Any number employees of these departments can be created by the admin and any UID can be given to the new employees that come to these selected departments)
These are the few things that a special department employees can do other than the normal ones that all
employees can do with their account.

Doctors:-
~~~~~~~~
For any doctors in the hospital to enter into their account they just have to enter their Unique ID
provided by the Admin at the time of their join into the hospital.

1.View their profile.
2.Change their data(but only few things like their address,email& phone number)
3.Look at the patients file and add any suggestions,medicines that he has to buy or 
4.Log out.

Patients:-
